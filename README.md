# Petri-nets-IIoT-NDT
This repository represents the artifact of our paper entitled : "Constructing a Network Digital Twin through Formal Modeling: Tackling the Virtual-Real Mapping Challenge in IIoT Networks". It contains all the scripts for deploying an IoT network and its Digital Twin using Eclipse Hono + Ditto. A Timed Petri-net is used to model the network.
